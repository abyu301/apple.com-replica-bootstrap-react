* React is a singl page application
. means- it only navigate or response for only one .html file. it hase only one entry point. in(ID- root)

* React Routing
. • What is routing in web development? Routing in web development is mapping of URLs
to functions, 
. meaning, it is the process of displaying different content (pages or data) depending on the URL address provided. 
. It is a mechanism where HTTP requests are routed to the code that handles them
. routing is a technology for switching between different server-side endpoints, based on the changes of the requested URL (holding the route)

*  Routing in front end development: front end routing is a technology for switching between different UI views, based on the changes of the current URL (holding the route). 
. Front end routing is handled from the browser, The server responses with the defaulted ‘index.html’ and the browser displays the index.html of the requested URL. 
. Note: Front-end routing is more used in single-page applications because single-page applications are basically front-end and back-end separated, and the back end naturally will not provide routing for the front-end.

* Single-page application (SPA): SPA is a website/application that loads only a single web document and renders that page on the browse.
. Single page websites do not need reloading of other pages during use. 
. The way such applications update their body contents is through JavaScript using methods like fetch(). 
. This allows users to use websites without loading whole new pages from the server, 
. Facebook and Gmail where there is just one web page that you visit which then loads all other content using JavaScript.

* Multiple-page applications: Every change (such as,  display the data or submit data back to server) requests rendering a new page from the server in the browser.
. These applications are large and due to the amount of content, these applications have many levels of UI.
. Examples of multi-page applications include eCommerce websites, blogs, forums, other sites that sell products and various services. 

* Routing in back end development:
. We know that the client sends requests to the server and the server responds back with a response to the client.
. In back end routing, the server handles every request by responding to the client with a code 201(I got that thing you want!) or a 404 (Nope, I don’t have that!).


// BrowserRouter
// To add the ability to add routing functionality
// Switch
// Checks provided paths and stops checking all as soon as it finds a match
// Route
// Renders components based on the URL



* procedure
  . npm i react-router-dom
  .  import BrowserRouter
    - applay or rap in .index.js <app /> with  BrowserRouter, firt import from react-router-dom.
      . BrowserRouter component is used to wrapes your applications and provide the routing functionality.
      . 
  . go to  app.js and import from react {Route} and
    . wrap all components the one has in app.js on <Routes>
      . Routes component wrape everythingthat are dependent on Route. first import { Routes } from "react-router-dom" . 
      . on this time our app is break, becouse it wraped with route.
  . <Route> 
    . components define the relationship bettween a path and component to be rendered when the path is matched.
    - 2 property yiyizal: path & element, element jsx nw yemikebelewu {} wusit.
    . go to app.js:  import { Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom" 
    . wrape all components under  Routes
